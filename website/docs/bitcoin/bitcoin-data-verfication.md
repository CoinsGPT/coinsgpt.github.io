# 06 Bitcoin Data Verification

To **verify that Bitcoin block and transaction data is complete in ClickHouse**, you need to ensure:

1. **No missing blocks**
2. **No missing transactions**
3. **No duplicate block heights**
4. **Transaction counts match block metadata**

## 1. block height continuity

Run this to detect missing block numbers:

```sql
WITH seq AS (
    SELECT number
    FROM numbers(
        toUInt64(
            ifNull((SELECT max(number) FROM blocks), 0) + 1
        )
    )
)
SELECT seq.number AS missing_block_number
FROM seq
LEFT JOIN blocks AS b ON seq.number = b.number
WHERE b.number != seq.number
```

If this query returns rows, those block numbers are missing.


## 2. Check for duplicate blocks

Check for duplicate block numbers (heights):

```sql
SELECT number, count() AS cnt
FROM blocks
GROUP BY number
HAVING cnt > 1
```

You should see **zero rows** returned.

if the count of one block is bigger than 1, please use final command to deduplicate the same rows

```shell
OPTIMIZE TABLE blocks FINAL;
```

## 3.Transactions Missing 

whether any transaction listed in the blocks_v1.transactions array is missing from the transactions table.

```sql
WITH flattened AS (
  SELECT
    hash as block_hash,
    tx_hash
  FROM blocks_v1
  ARRAY JOIN blocks_v1.transactions AS tx_hash
  -- block_hash = hash of the block
  -- tx_hash = each transaction hash in the array
)

SELECT
  flattened.block_hash,
  flattened.tx_hash
FROM flattened
LEFT JOIN transactions ON flattened.tx_hash = transactions.hash
WHERE transactions.hash IS NULL
LIMIT 100;

```

## 3. transaction consistency per block

If your `blocks` table has a `transaction_count` field, compare it to actual transaction counts:

```sql
SELECT
    b.number,
    b.hash,
    b.transaction_count AS expected_count,
    count(t.hash) AS actual_count
FROM blocks b
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON b.hash = t.block_hash
GROUP BY b.number, b.hash, b.transaction_count
HAVING expected_count != actual_count
```

This checks if the number of transactions recorded in each block matches whatâ€™s stored in the `transactions` table.

## 4. duplicate transactions

```sql
SELECT hash, count() AS cnt
FROM transactions
GROUP BY hash
HAVING cnt > 1
```

Again, this should return no rows.

## 5. block range coverage

Ensure your data starts from the genesis block (height = 0):

```sql
SELECT min(number), max(number), count() FROM blocks
```

Expected:

* `min(number) = 0`
* `max(number)` equals the current block height in the full node
* `count()` equals `max - min + 1`
